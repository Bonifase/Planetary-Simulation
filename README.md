# Planetary Simulation

Planet simulation using Python. 

Simulates the orbits of different planets around the sun using real astronomical values. 

Apply the force of gravity on each of the planets so as to get an accurate elliptical orbit.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
    ```sh
        git clone https://github.com/Bonifase/Planetary-Simulation.git
    ```
2. Create a virtual environment in the root directory with the following:
    ```sh
        pytnon3.9 -m venv venv
    ```

3. Activate the virtual environment and install all the required packages.
    ```sh
        source venv/bin/activate
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
